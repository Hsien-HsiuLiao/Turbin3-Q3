# Project Proposal

## Value Proposition
This app will empower concert goers by allowing them to search and contribute sound level data so they can make informed decisions on where to purchase seats. Additionally, there will be opportunities to connect and share experiences with other fans of the same artist. Reviews of the concert experience and venue, along with ratings, will help users make better decisions. 

Leveraging Solana blockchain technology, there are incentives to participate and contribute by earning tokens and owning data that they can sell to interested parties. There will be a focus on UX and market education, as web3 apps tend to be complicated to use and users may not understand the value of sound level data.

## Target Markets
- Young adults aged 18-34
- Music enthusiasts
- Parents of young concert-goers
- Tech-savvy blockchain enthusiasts
- Health-conscious concert goers

## Competitors
Bandsintown, Songkick, AudioTool, SmarterNoise, Decibel, TooNoisy, Silencio, and NoiseMeter all have some of the features of my project, and it would be beneficial to study how these apps attract and retain users. I will also need to consider indirect competitors, as social media has a powerful influence.

## Founder Market Fit
As a musician with over 30 years of experience performing in various bands, I have a deep understanding of the concert experience from both the performer’s and audience’s perspectives. Being health-conscious, I want people to make informed decisions about concerts regarding sound levels. 

With my network of musicians and blockchain enthusiasts, I can gather valuable feedback for my idea for continuous improvement. Although I have limited market experience, I will work with experts to better understand the broader market dynamics of mobile apps. I've previously developed a POC for a Solana dapp, and this experience will further prepare me for bringing this current idea to fruition.
