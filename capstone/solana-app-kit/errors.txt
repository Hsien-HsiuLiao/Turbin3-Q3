 ERROR  Error: Cannot find native module 'ExponentAV', js engine: hermes

  if you are using a development build, you can create a new one using:

eas build --profile development --platform <ios or android>

This ensures that the native modules are correctly included in the build.
 It is a common requirement to rebuild the development build whenever a new dependency with native code is added to the project.
