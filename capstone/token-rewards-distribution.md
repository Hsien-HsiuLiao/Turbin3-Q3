Token Minting
When minting a token on Solana, there are two token programs to choose from: the Token program or the Token22 program. There are tradeoffs to consider (discussed here). The recommended selection between the two options ultimately reduces to whether the features in the token extensions program would be of use to the application.

Rewards Distribution
A critical decision in DePIN architecture design is how and how often to distribute your token. There are three major approaches to rewards distributions:

Claim based: Users have to claim their reward. This can be done in multiple ways, detailed further below.
Push based: Rewards are directly sent to contributors. It's the most expensive structure, due to the direct nature of the reward distribution.
Of these, a claims-based model is strongly recommended, given its efficiency. There are also ways to combine these models, such as allowing users to automate claiming-on-demand (Helium does this). However, it's recommended to start with one model and then add customizations as your solution scales.

Below, we dig in deeper on how the push and claim based approaches work, and compare the costs of each approach.

Claim based distribution
Users have to claim their reward. This can be done in multiple ways:

Via an off chain oracle that signs messages that people can use to claim in combination with on chain accounts that save the already claimed rewards
By co-signing claim transactions via an oracle
Saving the whole data on chain and calculating the rewards on the demand
Web2 backend where people authenticate and register with their wallet addresses and sending transactions from the backend on demand
Costs can be reduced by using Merkle tree airdrop on a customizable reward cadence.

Reward distribution via Merkle tree allows for efficient batch processing of claims. This approach is used to minimize the number of transactions on the blockchain by allowing users to claim their rewards based on a published Merkle root.

The application constructs a Merkle tree on a regular basis and publishes the root onchain. Each leaf node represents a recipient's rewards.

In order for users to claim their rewards, they generate a Merkle proof that demonstrates a particular leaf is part of the published Merkle root. Once their claim is verified, the rewards are distributed to the user's wallet.

See example code and Jupiter's Merkle distributor for an additional reference.

You can also use Tuktuk, a primitive published by Helium, to push reward claims via remote oracle.
